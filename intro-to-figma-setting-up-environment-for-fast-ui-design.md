# Intro to Figma & Setting up Environment for Fast UI Design

Today I learned some neat tips and tricks for more proficient designing using Figma. I also created some deafault styles and shortcuts and such.  
Added to my Design System as well.
A default for the approximate line length for a body text (the alphabet 3 times over),
a default 12 column grid, Floor Fades for displaying text on images where text may look different on  
different parts of the image.

# First Homework

First homework assignment is to choose a website I use frequently and design it.
Not much in terms of constraints. This will act as a baseline for your design skills.
I will be doing this using Figma.
I will design the dev.to site because eventually I want to write my own blog. I think I'll want
to write it from scratch to gain the experience.

## Progress

### 07/01/2020

- Began working on the Design in Figma.
- I was able to get the Header done.
  - Not the cleanest. I think I have some font mismatches.
  - I got the logo font pretty close I think, but the search bar text is noticeably off.
  - I think I did ok with the logos in the Header. That Connect button was a little strange
    with the little wisp(?idk if that is the right word)

### 07/02/2020

Working on the icons I made yesterday for the Header. Ended up refactoring them all.
Was unable to get much done. Left off working on left side bar

## Here's a link to what I have so far. If you have any suggestions, tips anything let me know :)

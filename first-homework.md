# First Homework

First homework assignment is to choose a website I use frequently and design it.
Not much in terms of constraints. This will act as a baseline for your design skills.
I will be doing this using Figma.
I will design the dev.to site because eventually I want to write my own blog. I think I'll want
to write it from scratch to gain the experience.

## Progress

### 07/01/2020

- Began working on the Design in Figma.
- I was able to get the Header done.
  - Not the cleanest. I think I have some font mismatches.
  - I got the logo font pretty close I think, but the search bar text is noticeably off.
  - I think I did ok with the logos in the Header. That Connect button was a little strange
    with the little wisp(?idk if that is the right word)

### 07/02/2020

Working on the icons I made yesterday for the Header. Ended up refactoring them all.
Was unable to get much done. Left off working on left side bar

## Here's a link to what I have so far. If you have any suggestions, tips anything let me know :)

### 07/06/2020

I finished the assignment today.
It's a very crude draft. I was getting burnt out while trying to do this.
I felt a little out of my league and didn't know where to take things. Like what's the next step?
How can I iterate over this to make it better? Those kinds of questions made me lose enthusiasm.
I haven't watched any other videos for the course yet and I feel like I've been working on this 1st  
Homework assignment for a while already.

I hope as I go through and learn best practices, and design patterns, I can learn to enjoy it more,
and feel more capable and up to the task.  
Some things that frustrated me:

- Spacing? How why? Standards?
- Type Face (Sizing, line height, space between letters..etc)
- Icon design. How do I make a heart? lol Or like nice bends/curves and stuff?
- Composition of Elements/Components.
- Naming of things.

Overall I'm excited to move forward. Will definitely revisit it as I learn more.
